Anscombe's Quartet
==================

<a href="http://www.d3js.org" target="_blank">D3.js</a> visualization of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anscombe's_quartet" target="_blank">Anscombe's Quartet</a>. Each dataset in the quartet is graphed separately along with its linear best fit. While all datasets have the same summary statistics (mean, variance, correlation, linear fit), their structures differ markedly. 

Anscombe used the quartet in his seminal paper <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/2682899" target="_blank">"Graphs in Statistical Analysis"</a> to emphasize the importance of data visualization for exploratory data analysis. Such visualization exploration enables the analyst to make more informed analytical decisions and conclusions.
